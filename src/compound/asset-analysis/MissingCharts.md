# Pie Chart for the distribution of circulating supply of assets
- In this chart we want to show the distribution of the asset by the holding amount buckets like between $0 - $100, $100 - $1000, etc.
- We want to see how much percentage of the circulating token supply is amongst the small token holders.
- The more % of total circulating supply amongst the small token holders, the more decentralized the asset is.
